## Architecture

### Design Principles

- **Feature-based structure**: Code is organized by feature (canvas, color, toolbar) rather than by type
- **Separation of concerns**: Business logic is extracted into custom hooks, UI stays in components
- **Colocation**: Tests, stories, and components live together within each feature
- **Reusable utilities**: Generic functions are placed in `lib/` for cross-feature use
